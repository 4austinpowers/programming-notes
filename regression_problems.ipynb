    "The purpose of this problem set is to put your regression skills to the test. As a GA student of data science, you have covered a number of sklearn regression techniques, so now is your chance to apply them. We'll be using the Boston Housing Dataset. Just kidding. I know you hate that one. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be exploring the relationships between sugar, economics, and teeth. You are given a dataset containing sugar consuption, healthcare spending, per capita GDP, literacy rate and the number of bad teeth per child across several hundred countries. What do you think? If you get richer, do your teeth get worse from more sugary foods, or better with health care assistance? Does education improve health, or drive excess? \n",

    "    1) What questions are relevant to ask? How do explore these your initial analysis?\n",
    "    2) You have only one data set. How do you split it into training and testing data?\n",
    "    3) How can you optimize on the default regression techniques? \n",
    "    4) How will you prevent overfitting? (Hint: look at the other files in this directory)\n",
    "    5) How can you effectively visualize the relationships?\n",
