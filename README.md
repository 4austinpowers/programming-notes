# Tutorials 

Posting these tutorials for a variety of reasons. Helping teach friends and strangers, keeping an archive of my own learning, experimenting with alternate ways of explaining a topic. But mostly because writing a tutorial forces me to structure my thinking and ingrains the key points of a topic in my own mind so that they're easier to remember. Plus I you or I can use these tidbits for quick reference when writing your own code. So enjoy! 

All topics are taught using Jupyter Notebooks because it allows the programming to interate and test ideas quickly, and the inline code and markdown reads more like a blog that a scipt of code. Props to the [xeus-cling](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-cling) project for enabling C++ in Jupyter. To run, make sure you have either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (recommended) or Python3+ and Jupyter installed. To install xeus-cling for C++, see the link above, or visit [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/momonala/xeus-cling/master?filepath=%2Fmohit) where I have a JupyterHub server running the C++ Jupyter Environment.
