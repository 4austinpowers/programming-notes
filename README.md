# Intuitive Data Science

The purpose of these notebooks is to help readers gain intuition on some messier data science and stats topics. Often when tackling a new subject, the hardest part is figuring out the right questions to ask. When you know what you are asking, it becomes a lot easier to find the answer. 

If you're learning data science, chances are you've come across a Wikipedia article that doubles as a PhD dissertation or a oversimplified "Learn Data Science in 3 minutes" Youtube video, starring a guy that drank 4 cups of coffee. There is a vacuum for a happy medium. My goal is make concise, readable explanations of arcane topics, so that you can start asking some excellent questions.
