# Python Tutorials 

Putting together various tutorials across various aspects of Python. Some of these stem from my time as a Data Science instructor at General Assembly, or friends asking how to learn python, or just becuase teaching a topic helps me understand it better! If you like what you see and want to see more, feel free to shoot me a message for a request :)
