# Python Tutorials 

Posting these tutorials for a variety of reasons. Helping teach friends, keeping an archive of my own learning, experimenting with alternate ways of explaining a topic. But mostly because writing a tutorial forces me to structure my thinking and reenforces the key points of a topic in my own mind. Plus you or I can use these snippets for quick reference when building other projects. So enjoy!
