Regarding our previous House class example, apartments and condos should contain all the same class attributes, like color, location, value, and size. Instead of copying code into the apartment and condo classes, we can make them children of Home and inherit the parent's properties. \n",

Not finding one (all we had was pass) it searched the parent class structure and borrowed code from there. To get a better idea of this, we can use Python's build in `help` method to explore how Apartment is working. Let's try that. "
