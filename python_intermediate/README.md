# Intermediate Tips and Tricks in Python! 

These are a collections of handy tips, tricks and tools in Python that are not completely obvious when first learning. I taught myself Python, and it was not always obvious why to use cetrain functions, like `with`, for example. I draw a lot from Dan Bader's book, Python Tricks: The Book. A great read if you want to dive deeper into the topics mentioned here.
