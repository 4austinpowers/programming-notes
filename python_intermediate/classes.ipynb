Additionally, when we create other methods inside a class, they recieve the instance as the first argument automatically. By convention, we call this instance `self`.\n",

    "The other arguments for `__init__` are whatever you need them to be. In our `House` example: color, size, and location. \n",
    " \n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the `self` property of the class is the instance itself. So saying `self.color = 'red'` inside of the `class` initializaion code is the same as saying `House1.color = 'red'` later on. However, since we are writing `self.color` inside of the `__init__` method, this is happening automatically when the class is instantiated! When we instantiate the `House` class as `house1`, we do not need to feed in `self` because that is done automatically. \n",
