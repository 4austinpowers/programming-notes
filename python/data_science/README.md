# Intuitive Data Science

The purpose of these notebooks is to help readers gain intuition on some messier data science and stats topics. I've included tutorials you can follow along with, and exercises I designed for the data science course I TA for at General Assembly. 

Often when tackling a new subject, the hardest part is figuring out the right questions to ask. When you know what you are asking, it becomes a lot easier to find the answer. If you're learning data science, chances are you've come across a Wikipedia article that could double as a PhD dissertation or a "Learn Machine Learning in 3 minutes" Youtube video that oversimplifies a complex topic. There is a vacuum for a happy medium. My goal is make concise, readable explanations of arcane topics, so that you can start asking some excellent questions.
