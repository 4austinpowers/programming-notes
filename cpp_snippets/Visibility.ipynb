    "## Visibility \n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility refers to the idea in object oriented programming about which variables and methods are visible to other classes and methods. Visibility does not affect performance or memory. It just helps code be more understandable and puts constraints on the code so it is not used incorrectly. This can be helpful to future you, and those who are trying to understand and build on your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "class A \n",
    "{\n",
    "    private: \n",
    "         int var; \n",
    "         void func(); \n",
    " \n",
    "     public: \n",
    "         A()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var = 2; \n",
    "        }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private\n",
    "\n",
    "A private variable or method is one that only the class that it is inside can see. Ex. \n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "A a; \n",
    "a.var = 4; \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would yield an error, since we are trying to access a private variable, var, outside of the class. There is once exception to this rule, which is the use of the Friend keyword. A second class can be marked as a friend of A, giving it access to A's private data. Even a subclass inheriting from A cannot access those data. However, the constructor is free to access these data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protected\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected is slightly more open than private. Protected data can be accessed by the parent class and by all subclasses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "class A \n",
    "{\n",
    "    protected: \n",
    "         int var; \n",
    "         void func(); \n",
    " \n",
    "     public: \n",
    "         A()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var = 2; \n",
    "        }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class B : A\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public: \n",
    "        B()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            var = 200; \n",
    "        }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "So this would be OK, where the B subclass constructor can change the protected variable, var. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public \n",
    "\n",
    "These can be accessed anywhere! No rules, woohoo!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whats the point? \n",
    "\n",
    "Why mark different data with different visibility. To help others. If someone else sees your code with a function marked as private, then they know that the shouldn't and don't need to access that function. Maybe there is another way to do it, or maybe accessng it breaks other code somewhere else down the line.  As the author of the code, you should be vigilant about your data members to make sure that you are correctly using visibility to help your code be more robust and maintainable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can even be helpful to yourself, since its easy to forget why you wrote something a certain way! "
