    "Using C++ Macro is about using the preprocessor to automate some text editing steps. As you may know, the preprocessor is responsible for taking any code prefaced with a `#` and manipulating it with some rules. `#include` copy and pastes header files, and `#define` does a 'find and replace' in the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "A macro can take advantage of these properties of find and replace to automate some annoying text editing. Senarios where this may be useful include creating cross platform code, or acoiding writing long repetitive text. Lets see some examples. "
