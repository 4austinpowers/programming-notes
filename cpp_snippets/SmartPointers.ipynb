    "## Smart Pointers \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that `new` is used to create variables on the heap, and `delete` is used to delete those variables to free up space. Smart Pointers are a way to automate that process; so you don't have to call delete after delete. They are a wrapper around a real raw pointer. There are different types of smart pointers that solve this problem for different use-cases. \n",

    "#### Unique Pointer \n",
    "\n",
    "A unique pointer is a scoped pointer, who's lifetime is determined by the scope it is in. You can't copy a unique pointer, since its pointing to a specific place in memory, so when the unique pointer dies, any other references to that pointer would also die. \n",
