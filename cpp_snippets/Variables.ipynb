    "## Variables in C++ \n",
    "\n",
    "When we write code, we typically want to manipulate data in some way. Maybe change the contents of a file, merge and clean data from various files together, generate information to create images in a video game, or perfom statistics on buisiness or science data. Any type of data we want to use in the code must be stored somehow. We accomplish this with variables. Variables are simply containers for data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables hold the data by storing them in the computer's memory (RAM). This is a temporary storage, so the variables only exist while the program is running. But within the code, we can even save those variables permanately by writing them to disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have types. We can store numeric data, text data, or even types of data we create ourselves. In C++, and most languages, we are given a set of basic data types, these are called primitives. These primities are like atoms, the cannot be broken down into further data types, and they are the building blocks for all the rest of the type of code we create. All data types have a specific size, and we can take advantage of this feature in clever ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets create some primitive data types and variables. \n",

    "#### Integers \n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers, and take 4 bytes of memory. We can store numbers roughly from negative to positive 2 billion. You can do math for this: 1 byte is 8 bits, which can have a value of 0 or 1. So 4 bytes is 32 bits, and the first bit is for postive or negative specification. So the remaining 2^31 = 2147483648\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a variable by declaring the data type, then the varible name, the value (optional), and close if off with a semicolon. You don't have to give the data type a value immediately, you can assign it, or reassign an existing variable, later in the code. When reassigning, you do not need to specify the data type anymore. "

Its the same thing under the hood, but it makes understanding and using these abstractions easier to think about if we designate a separation between text and numbers. \n",
