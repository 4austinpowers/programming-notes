    "Great. This works as expected. But this will all crumble if we decide to use polymorphism. That is, this won't work if we decide to refer to any Player object as an entity object. For example, say we have a method that takes in an Entity object, so it will also take in any method that inherits from Entity, and calls the method GetName, which has been reimplemented in the subclass. One might expect that it would call the GetName method based off of the object that was being passed in right? Right??"
