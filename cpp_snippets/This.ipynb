    "`This` is a keyword that is only accessible through a membor function, or within a method of a class. It is a pointer to the current instance of the class that the method belongs to. It is exactly like `self` in Python. More concretley, if I have a class `CL` with variable `x`, and an instance of the class `Inst`, then a member function in `CL` that says `this.x` will allow `Inst` to access its `x` variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, I want to assign the variable x in the `set_x` method. However, if the method argument is `x`, simply writing `x=x;` would reassign the temporary variable with itself, not assign the `x` class variable. What we can do instead is use `this->x` to access the current object instance's `x` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use the arrow operator to access members of this, since it is a pointer. See the [notes on the arrow operator](Arrow.ipynb) for more. "
